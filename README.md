# Data Structures and Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains my structured learning and implementation of
Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.

## What this repo includes
- Clean implementations of core data structures
- Problem-solving patterns used in interviews
- Time & space complexity analysis
- Gradual progression from fundamentals to advanced topics

## Structure
Each folder represents a core DSA concept.
Problems are grouped by pattern, not by difficulty.

## Language
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries (logic-first approach)

## Goal
To build strong problem-solving skills and deep understanding of DSA.
